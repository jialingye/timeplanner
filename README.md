# Project-2
<p> My app is a powerful time tracking and to-do list app that helps users manage their tasks and stay productive.  </p>

## Project Choice 
<h2>Time Block</h2>
<p>I am motivated to work on this project because I have a mobile app that I really enjoy using. However, I would like to make some changes and adapt it to be usable on a computer as well. By doing so, I can enhance the app's functionality and convenience, and make it accessible to a wider audience.</p>
